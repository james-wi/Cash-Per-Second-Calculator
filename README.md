Cash-Per-Second-Calculator
==========================

A basic (and right now pretty ugly) Python app using Tkinter, to help me with games in which I earn a certain amount of money over time (I made it with Adventure Capitalist in mind).

A quick look at the running program:

cash_per_sec.py is the main Python file to be run.

The config file contains 3 options at the moment - the number of rows, the currency symbol to use, and the abbreviations.

The data file is where the program stores data that has been saved, to be loaded later.
